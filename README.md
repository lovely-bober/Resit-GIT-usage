Smart Home Integration: Domoticz & Philips Hue
This repository contains Python scripts for controlling Philips Hue lamps via the Domoticz home automation platform. It demonstrates how to interact with Domoticzâ€™s API to switch Hue lights on/off and change their color/brightness.

Overview
Purpose: Automate and control Philips Hue lamps using Domoticz.

- Switch the light on or off

- Set the light color using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)

- Set the light color using RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

- Set the light color by common color name (e.g., "red", "blue", "orange")

Features:
- Easy Color Control: Choose colors using HSV, RGB, or by name.

- Brightness Adjustment: Set brightness level (0-100).

- Simple On/Off: Quickly toggle the light.

- Built-in Color Names: Use common names for quick color changes.

- Technology Stack: Python, Domoticz, Philips Hue.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

- requests library (pip install requests)

- A running Domoticz server (default URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080)

- The device index (idx) of your Philips Hue or compatible light in Domoticz

Customization
- Add More Colors: Edit the COLOR_RGB dictionary to add more named colors.

- Change Device: Update the idx variable for a different light.

Troubleshooting
- Connection errors: Ensure Domoticz is running and accessible at the specified URL.

- Authentication errors: Double-check your username and password.

- Light not responding: Ensure the correct idx is set for your device.


How to Use
- Clone or download this repository

- Make sure you have Python 3 and the "requests" lbrary installed: pip install requests

- Open the script in your editor or run it directly in the terminal: python smart_home_test.py

- Choose one of the following options when prompted:
- `1`: Set light color using HSV values
- `2`: Set light color using RGB values
- `3`: Set color using a color name (e.g., `"blue"`, `"orange"`)
- `4`: Switch the light on or off
- `5`: Show a list of supported color names

- Follow the on-screen instructions to enter values (e.g., hue, brightness).

- After each action, you can choose whether to perform another one.

This script runs in a **loop**, so you can test multiple light actions without restarting the script.
